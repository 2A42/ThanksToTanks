# ThanksToTanks
"ThanksToTanks" is an arcade tank game in the genre of "hold out as long as possible". The main aim was to get practice when working with C++ and libraries (in this case SFML)

!ATTENTION! Almost all sprites && sounds were taken from the internet or other games. All rights to these materials belong to their creators.

To run project you must install SFML-2.5.1. For Visual Studio(not VS code) users i recomend this tutorial: http://www.geofhagopian.net/CS007B/CS7B-F19/SFML%20Setup%20in%20Visual%20Studio%202019.pdf
